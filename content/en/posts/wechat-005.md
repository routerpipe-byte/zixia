Today, we habitually believe that "the West has always been ahead of China," but this is actually a historical illusion shaped in reverse by the results of the Industrial Revolution.

1. The "rearview mirror" illusion of history Many Chinese people today have an almost unconscious subconscious belief:
The West seems inherently more advanced than China.

But this is actually a typical historical illusion,
shaped in reverse by the results of the Industrial Revolution.

We are accustomed to looking back from the pinnacle of modern civilization,
thus placing a filter over history that says,
"The West was destined to lead."

In fact, if we view human civilization as a marathon,
China, for the vast majority of time,
has been the leading frontrunner.

It wasn't until the Age of Exploration in the 15th century
that the balance truly began to tilt.

For comparison, let's set the coordinates at the year 1100 AD—
the mid-to-late Northern Song Dynasty.

You will find that in terms of:

City scale

Institutional efficiency

Fiscal systems

Even the freedom of ordinary people

On these hard metrics,
the Song Dynasty at that time
was like a "dimensional reduction strike" from the future.

The reason we misjudge history
is because we look back at the process from the perspective of the outcome.

2. Cities: Commercial civilization vs. war fortresses Want to understand the cities of the Song Dynasty?
No need for complex data,
just look at one painting: "Along the River During the Qingming Festival."

The protagonists of this painting are not emperors,
not myths,
but:

Busy merchants

Resting citizens

Bustling boatmen on the Bian River

Rows of taverns and pharmacies

This is not just "bustling,"
but a highly mature urban economic structure.

Comparison at a glance: Northern Song Bianliang vs. contemporary Europe (e.g., Paris/London)

Dimension Northern Song Bianliang (Kaifeng) Contemporary Europe (e.g., Paris) Population scale 1 million-level (the world's first city that never sleeps) Only a few thousand to tens of thousands Living mode Completely abolished curfews, night markets open all night City gates tightly shut, silence after dark Core function Commercial center, consumer center, social center Refuge, defensive fortifications, power nodes In summary:

The cities of the Song Dynasty were "living societies,"
while European cities were merely "components of feudal lords."

3. Institutions: Mature state machinery vs. fragmented feudal puzzle In 1100 AD, the Song Dynasty
operated a centralized system far ahead of its time.

Civil governance:
Officials were appointed, assessed, and rotated by the central government,
effectively eliminating local hereditary separatism.

Unified national system:
Standardized taxation, laws, and household registration,
allowing efficient cross-regional allocation of finances and grain.

Meanwhile, contemporary Europe
resembled a fragmented "puzzle":

Kings were often just "the largest lords"

Power was divided up by nobles and the church

Farmers faced ruthless private lords directly,
rather than national laws

While the Song Dynasty governed through institutions,
Europe was still relying on bloodlines and feudal contracts.

Europe did not achieve true statehood
until the 18th century.

Whether a country can operate long-term
depends on whether it relies on institutions
or bloodlines.

4. Talent: The imperial examination system vs. hereditary rule (the truth about social mobility) This is the most "modern" aspect of ancient Chinese institutions:
The imperial examination system.

In 1100 AD China,
a poor student from a remote rural area
could, through studying and exams,
ultimately enter the power core in Kaifeng.

This logic of "fair competition and merit-based selection"
broke the monopoly of bloodlines on power.

In contrast, contemporary Europe:
Practiced an extremely rigid hereditary aristocracy.

Europe:
If you were born a farmer,
you would remain a farmer for life.
Social mobility was locked within bloodlines,
leaving no hope for grassroots elites.

China:
"One morning a humble farmer, by evening in the emperor's hall."
The imperial examination system provided continuous social mobility,
absorbing the intelligence and talents of the populace into national governance.

While the Song Dynasty governed through "brainpower,"
Europe was still relying on "birth" to determine fate.

5. Military: A "great national war machine," not "weak and impoverished" For a long time, we have severely misunderstood the military strength of the Song Dynasty.The "weakness" of the Song Dynasty  
was not because it was not strong,  
but because it faced—  
the most brutal and most advanced nomadic military peak in human history.

**Organizational strength:**  
The Northern Song Dynasty had a standing army of 800,000–1.2 million soldiers,  
uniformly supported by the national treasury.

**Logistics system:**  
A systematic supply of military provisions,  
distribution of military pay,  
standardized weapon manufacturing.

This was already  
the embryonic form of a modern state war machine.

**Comparison with contemporary Europe:**  

There was no standing national army.  

The military core consisted of feudal knights.  

Kings had to "beg and plead" with lords to mobilize forces for war.  

Actual troop numbers were usually only a few thousand.  

Although ancient China and Europe never engaged in direct warfare, indirect comparisons reveal:  

The Xiongnu driven away by the Han Dynasty became Europe's nightmare ("Scourge of God"), shaping the later Hungary.  
The Turks repelled by the Tang Dynasty re-emerged in West Asia as the Ottoman Empire, personally ending the Eastern Roman Empire.

What were "defeated remnants" for Chinese dynasties  
were "war gods" in Europe.

**6. Happiness: Who were the true "free people"?**  
This is the most mind-bending point:  
Ancient Chinese people  
might have been far happier than medieval Europeans.

① **Fuller pockets (tax burden)**  
**Song Dynasty:**  
Primarily state taxes,  
typical tax rates were about 5%–10%,  
with legally guaranteed relief mechanisms during disaster years.

**Europe:**  
Triple exploitation,  
combined extraction often reached 25%–35% annually.

② **Greater personal freedom (personal rights)**  
**Song Dynasty:**  
Legally, there were no serfs.  
Tenant farmers and landlords had economic contract relationships,  
and they could freely migrate or change professions.

**Europe:**  
Serfdom prevailed,  
serfs could not marry freely,  
could not leave the land,  
were not considered people but the "assets" of lords.

The Song Dynasty's conflict was "wealth disparity,"  
Europe's conflict was "personal bondage."

**7. Turning point: Why did we "lose" later?**  
Given China's early and stable start,  
why did it fall behind later?

The true historical turning point  
lay—on the seas.

**Zheng He vs. Columbus: Two completely different logics**  
**Zheng He (imperial project):**  
Massive in scale,  
core logic was "showing off."  
The emperor funded it for the sake of prestige and universal submission.

**Result:**  
Brought back giraffes from distant Africa,  
brought back prestige,  
but failed to bring back sustainable profits.

Once the emperor died,  
the system automatically shut down.

**European navigation (capital expansion):**  
Merchants funded it,  
the state provided protection,  
core logic was "plunder and colonization."

**Result:**  
Silver and slaves flowed continuously into Europe,  
trade was monopolized by European states and capital,  
the Industrial Revolution was ignited as a result.

Until the Western powers' gunboats knocked on the Qing Dynasty's door, the Chinese suddenly realized—  
the world had already unknowingly undergone a cross-era leap.

**8. In-depth reflection: The three "tight constraints" that locked us down**  
China was ultimately overtaken,  
and fundamentally, this was due to systemic differences in three dimensions,  
two of which were already pointed out by Chinese youth intellectuals during the May Fourth Movement.

① **Technology but lack of scientific thought (difference in thinking)**  
Ancient China had strong technological accumulation  
(e.g., *The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art*, Four Great Inventions),  
but lacked a systematic scientific framework.

Europe, during the Renaissance,  
revisited the rational thought of ancient Greece.  
Historical article: Europe once "lost" an entire civilization—why did ancient Greek rational knowledge disappear during medieval Europe?

It developed:  

- Logical deduction  
- Mathematical expression  
- A falsifiable experimental spirit  

Technology is the summary of experience,  
science is the explosion of logic.

② **Centralized power vs. power checks and balances (political logic)**  
Ancient China had highly centralized monarchial autocracy,  
with decision-making pressure concentrated on the emperor alone.

This was a  
"single point of failure" system:  

- A wise emperor brought prosperity.  
- A foolish emperor caused total collapse.  

Europe, however, had a long tradition of republicanism and parliamentary prototypes.  
Historical article: Why did Europe move toward democracy?—The republican tradition was not an accidental historical choice.

Though chaotic,  
it established a mechanism for error correction that did not rely on enlightened rulers.

③ **Unified "path dependency" vs. multi-state competition "evolution"**  
China's geography was enclosed and conducive to unification,  
combined with highly uniform language and culture,  
resulting in a long-term lack of internal competitive pressure.A successful system can be infinitely replicated, ultimately falling into the "dynastic cycle."

As for Europe:

Peninsulas, islands, and oceans divide the space

Multiple countries coexist and compete with each other

Failed systems are eliminated

Innovative systems are emulated

China wins in stability, but loses the impetus for mutation in stability;

Europe loses in chaos, but in chaos, it opens the door to modernization.

Conclusion: It's not about pride or inferiority, but a clear review of this history, not to indulge in past glory, nor to be passively self-deprecating, but to be clear-headed.

The backwardness of modern China is not because we "never succeeded," but because during the critical window for breakthroughs, we were locked in by the path we once proudly followed.

Only by understanding the path we've taken can we accurately find our direction.
