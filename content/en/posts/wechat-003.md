At the dawn of human civilization, two mathematical works emerged almost simultaneously, yet like two rivers flowing in different directions, they quietly shaped completely different intellectual traditions in the East and the West.

One originated in China,  
the other in ancient Greece.

They are:

China's *"Nine Chapters on Mathematical Procedures"*  
Ancient Greece's *"Elements"* (a translated title of part of Euclid's *"Mathematical Principles"*).

Even today, our understanding of science, technology, and even artificial intelligence still carries the genetic legacy of these two books.

### I. Historical Context: Philosophers' Truth vs. Administrators' Handbook

In the history of Western science, the earliest and most influential mathematical work is Euclid's *"Elements"* (later often referred to as the origin of "Euclidean geometry").  
In the history of ancient Chinese science, the earliest, most widely circulated, and most influential mathematical classic is the *"Nine Chapters on Mathematical Procedures"*, completed during the Han Dynasty.

Comparing these two "most important mathematical classics of their respective civilizations" is not about determining which is superior, but about understanding a more practical question:

Why did ancient mathematics of equally high caliber  
ultimately contribute to modern natural science through two completely different paths?

---

#### 1️⃣ *"Elements"*: Mathematics existing for "truth itself"

**Completion Time**: Around 300 BCE  
**Author**: Euclid  
**Role**: A "logical ladder" to universal laws

*"Elements"* does not concern itself with harvests, taxation, or engineering costs.  
It focuses on a more fundamental question:

How should mathematics itself be defined?

It establishes a "deducible world":  
Starting from the fewest premises, it derives as many necessary conclusions as possible.  
This is why many Western disciplines later regarded it as a "model for theoretical writing and scientific argumentation."

Some even point out that the structure of Newton's *"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"* clearly borrowed from Euclid's system of "definitions—axioms—propositions—proofs."

---

#### 2️⃣ *"Nine Chapters on Mathematical Procedures"*: Mathematics serving the real world

**Completion Time**: Around 2nd century BCE–1st century CE (Western Han to Eastern Han)  
**Author**: Compiled and supplemented by generations of mathematicians  
**Role**: A "management manual" for a unified empire

It addresses the most practical problems:

- Land measurement  
- Tax calculation  
- Engineering construction (building dams, warehouses, digging canals)

This is a book written for officials and engineers.  
It does not pursue "the pure truth of the universe"; it pursues:

Solving problems accurately, quickly, and effectively.

Precisely because of this strong practicality, the research and application of *"Nine Chapters"* persisted in China for a long time, even extending into the Ming and Qing dynasties—it almost became the "standard algorithm library" for ancient social governance and engineering systems.

### II. Divergent Starting Points: Beginning with "Definitions" vs. Beginning with "Problems"

---

#### 📐 *"Elements"*: Constructing the universe from nothing

Euclid's opening does not calculate areas or solve equations;  
it first defines the world itself.

Original text:

**Definition 1**: A point is that which has no part.  
**Definition 2**: A line has length only, without width.  
**Postulate 1**: A straight line can be drawn from any point to any other point.

Here, Euclid is not calculating but abstractly modeling.  
The entire book is built on an extremely rigorous deductive chain:

Definition → Axiom/Postulate → Proposition → Proof

This is mathematics starting from **"why it must hold true."**

---

#### 🌾 *"Nine Chapters on Mathematical Procedures"*: Wisdom growing from the land

The opening of *"Nine Chapters"* is extremely "down-to-earth."  
Each chapter almost always begins with a sentence:

*"Now there is..."*  
(Now there is such a real-world problem.)

Original text:

*"Now there is a field 15 steps wide and 16 steps long. What is the area of the field?"*  
**Procedure**: Multiply the width and length to obtain the area.

Its structure is very stable:

Problem → Result → Procedure (Algorithm)

It does not explain why "length × width = area."  
It directly provides you with a reusable algorithm called "procedure"—  
From today's perspective, it is almost like a piece of pseudocode.

---

### III. The Same Mathematics, Different Thought Paths

---

#### 1️⃣ Pythagorean Theorem: Proving necessity vs. Applying effectiveness

**"Elements"**  
In Proposition I.47, Euclid rigorously proves the logical necessity of the relationship between the three sides of a right triangle through complex geometric constructions.

**"Nine Chapters on Mathematical Procedures"**  
Directly provides the formula:  

*"Square the two shorter sides, add them together, and take the square root to find the hypotenuse."*  
It then immediately applies this: measuring water depth, calculating tree height, determining engineering scales.

One focuses on proving **"why it must be correct,"**  
the other focuses on verifying **"whether it is sufficiently useful."**

---

#### 2️⃣ Engineering Problems: The "Calculation Duel" of Dam Volume

In ancient mathematical exams (e.g., the Tang Dynasty's "Advanced Mathematics Exam"), there was a highly representative engineering problem:

**Prototype Problem (from the "Chapter on Construction"):**

*"Now there is a dam, with a bottom width of 2 zhang, a top width of 8 chi, a height of 4 chi, and a length of 12 zhang 7 chi.  
What is the volume?"*

**Procedure (Algorithm):**

*"Add the top and bottom widths, halve the sum, multiply by the height, then multiply by the length."*

This is the standard trapezoidal volume algorithm.

If Euclid were to solve this:  
He would require you to prove the trapezoidal area formula's validity and decompose the trapezoid into multiple triangles for derivation.  
Chinese candidates only needed to: move counting rods and execute the algorithm.

This highly algorithmic educational system gave ancient China exceptionally strong engineering execution capabilities—  
It could turn "governance" into "computable," and "engineering" into "operable."

---

#### 3️⃣ Positive and Negative Numbers: The Art of Red and Black

This is one of China's most important contributions to human mathematics.

*"Nine Chapters on Mathematical Procedures"* · Chapter on Equations  
Introduced positive and negative numbers to handle coefficient cancellation:

*"Red rods represent positive, black rods represent negative."*  
It systematically provided addition and subtraction rules for positive and negative numbers.

In contrast:  
Ancient Greek mathematics long held that "length cannot be negative," thus deeming negative numbers absurd.

Chinese mathematicians' attitude was more like engineers:  
As long as the algorithm's logic is consistent, it does not need to be intuitively visible.

### IV. If You Only Glance at the Full Text, This Table Suffices

| Dimension | *"Nine Chapters"* (Eastern) | *"Elements"* (Western) |  
|-----------|-----------------------------|------------------------|  
| Thinking Preference | Algorithmic Thinking: How to calculate | Logical Thinking: Why it works |  
| Mathematical Form | Discrete, algebraic, numerical computation | Continuous, geometric, spatial modeling |  
| Methodology | Inductive: Summarizing general rules from cases | Deductive: Deriving specific conclusions from axioms |  
| Focus | Executability and efficiency | Consistency and universality |  
| Weakness | Lacks rigorous logical proof, overly reliant on empirical summaries | Detached from practicality, once considered "impractical" |  
| Scientific Contribution | Ensured the long-term continuation of engineering and governance technologies | Provided the logical foundation for the grand edifice of modern natural science |

---

### V. Key Divergence: Why Did *"Nine Chapters"* "Last Long" but Not "Lay Foundations" Like *"Elements"*?

The practicality of *"Nine Chapters"* indeed ensured its research and application in China persisted into the Ming and Qing dynasties:  
Many later mathematicians often deepened and expanded upon the problems posed in *"Nine Chapters."*

But it also has an unavoidable structural shortcoming:  
It almost never provides clear mathematical concepts, theorem systems, or systematic proofs.

*"Elements"*, on the other hand, is the opposite:  
It may not directly build dams, but it offers the "scaffolding for the scientific edifice":

- How to define concepts  
- How to set axioms and postulates  
- How to prove propositions  
- How to construct a consistent system  

This structure profoundly influenced later natural sciences—  
Modern natural science requires not only "being able to calculate" but also "being able to establish theories."

Thus, the final result is:  
*"Nine Chapters"* is more like a "governance and engineering algorithm library,"  
*"Elements"* is more like a "scientific theory construction manual."

---

### VI. How Does This Divergence Continue Today?

This difference in "algorithm genes" and "logical genes" reappears in the 21st century.

**Western (Elements Gene)** excels at going from 0 to 1:  
Neural network theory, large model frameworks, computational paradigm innovation  
Solving: Why the model is feasible

**Eastern (Nine Chapters Gene)** excels at going from 1 to 100:  
Algorithm compression, inference acceleration, engineering implementation, cost optimization  
Solving: How to make the model perfect

This is not about which is more advanced,  
but about different paths of choice.

---

### Conclusion

*"Nine Chapters on Mathematical Procedures"* is the wisdom of the earth, teaching us how to pragmatically solve problems;  
*"Elements"* is the contemplation under the stars, teaching us how to construct a rational world.

Even today, we still stand at the intersection of these two traditions.

True breakthroughs often come from:

Using logic to test algorithms,  
Using algorithms to realize logic.
