In medieval Christian Europe, the systematic interruption of Greek mathematics, philosophy, and science was caused by language fragmentation, the collapse of the educational system, and religious monopoly. In contrast, Greek knowledge was completely preserved, translated, and developed in the Byzantine and Islamic worlds, eventually returning to Europe through cross-civilization transport, igniting the Renaissance.

Many people instinctively believe:

Since Europe is the successor of ancient Greece and Rome,
mathematics, philosophy, and science
should naturally be passed down in Europe.

But the real history is quite the opposite—

In medieval Christian Europe,
the rational knowledge of ancient Greece almost experienced a systematic interruption;
while the Islamic world truly preserved, translated, researched, and further developed it.

This is not a value judgment,
but a historical result formed by

language → system → religion → politics

layer by layer fragmentation.

I. Ancient Greece: The Starting Point of Rational Civilization (approximately 6th–3rd century BC)

Starting from the 6th century BC,
ancient Greece, in the history of human civilization,
completed the first true rational leap:

Mathematics was written as an axiomatic system: "Elements" (Euclid)

Philosophy was written as logical arguments (Plato, Aristotle)

Natural phenomena began to detach from mythological explanations

But this civilization had an extremely fragile premise:

It was highly dependent on language, educational systems, and manuscript transmission.

II. Plato and Aristotle are not "thoughts," but complete original systems Ancient Greek philosophy is not a "collection of viewpoints" pieced together by later generations,
but a complete system of knowledge composed of original works.

Plato (approximately 427–347 BC)

He conducted philosophical training in the form of dialogues:

"The Republic": Justice, State, Philosopher King

"Symposium": How love moves from sensuality to ideas

"Phaedo": The immortality of the soul

"Theaetetus": What is "knowledge"

Its core is the theory of ideas:
The rational world is higher than the sensual world.

Aristotle (384–322 BC)

He was the first person in human history to systematically organize all categories of knowledge:

Logic: "Organon"

Ontology: "Metaphysics"

Natural Science: "Physics," "On the Soul"

Biology: "History of Animals"

Political Ethics: "Nicomachean Ethics," "Politics"

📌 He laid the foundation for logical reasoning, classification methods, and empirical observation.

III. A decisive premise—All of this was written in Greek These works were all written in highly abstract Greek,
relying on the educational system of academies and the tradition of manuscript copying.

Once language is fragmented and systems collapse,
knowledge does not "slowly decline,"
but directly crashes.

IV. Rome inherited Greece but did not complete the dissemination of knowledge (from 146 BC)

After Rome conquered Greece, society became clearly stratified:

Upper elite: Greek language, Greek philosophy

Ordinary people and the army: Latin

📌 The language of knowledge and the language of society split.

Rome inherited the achievements,
but did not establish a universal education and knowledge transmission system.

V. Christianization as the State Religion—Transfer of Knowledge Legitimacy (380 AD) In 380 AD,
the Roman Empire established Christianity as the state religion.

From then on:

Source of truth → Bible

Interpretation rights → Church

Classical philosophy and natural research → Pagan heritage

Rationality did not immediately disappear,
but began to gradually lose institutional protection.

VI. After the fall of Western Rome, did Europeans really "bathe only three times in their lives"? In 476 AD, the Germanic mercenary leader Odoacer deposed the Western Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus.

After the fall of Western Rome, not only philosophy and science were fragmented,
but daily civilization itself was also disrupted.

One of the most direct and easily understood examples:
Bathing.

During ancient Rome:

Public baths were widespread in cities

Hot and cold water systems, underfloor heating, and sewers were complete

Bathing was both for cleanliness and socializing

Medieval Western Europe:

Cities declined, public baths disappeared on a large scale

The church's vigilance against "nudity and pleasure" increased

The belief that "bathing makes people sick" prevailedThus emerged the popular saying of today:

"Medieval Europeans only bathed three times in their lives: birth, marriage, death."

This is not entirely fabricated—  
"Minimize bathing" and "not bathing is healthier"  
were indeed taken seriously as a lifestyle concept  
in late medieval Western Europe.

When systems and urban civilization collapsed,  
humans even actively abandoned  
the living technologies they had already mastered.

### 7. Divergence of Civilization: Greek Civilization Survives in Eastern Rome  
Meanwhile, in Eastern Rome (Byzantium):  

- The official and church language remained Greek  
- Plato and Aristotle's original works were systematically preserved  
- Continuity of urban life, education, and administration was maintained  

However, after the East-West Church Schism in 1054,  
knowledge was completely isolated by religious and political boundaries.

### 8. How the Islamic World Preserved Greek Civilization (8th–10th Century)  
Contrary to today's stereotypes,  
the Islamic world of the 8th–10th centuries  
was one of the most rational, affluent, and internationalized civilizations of its time.

After the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate (750 CE):  

- The "House of Wisdom" was founded in Baghdad in the 9th century  
- Greek philosophy, mathematics, and medicine were systematically translated  
- Works of Plato, Aristotle, and Euclid were fully introduced  

More importantly:  

They not only translated,  
but also studied, collated, and developed the knowledge further.

When medieval Europeans first truly entered  
Byzantine and Islamic cities,  
what they encountered was not "pagan barbarism,"  
but rather:  

- Water systems and public baths  
- Hospitals, pharmacies, and university-like institutions  
- Prosperous urban life and international trade networks  

📌 This is not a fabricated praise by later generations,  
but a genuine shock repeatedly recorded in Crusader documents.

### 9. Jerusalem: Different Attitudes Toward Non-Believers  
This difference in civilization  
was particularly evident in Jerusalem.

In 1099, the Crusaders captured Jerusalem:  

- Large-scale massacres  
- Indiscriminate killing of civilians  

Under Muslim rule in Jerusalem:  

- Non-believers were allowed to retain their faith  
- They could freely choose to stay or leave  
- They only needed to pay a poll tax to live  

This is not a moral judgment,  
but a factual observation of the system:  

Only societies that allow coexistence of multiple faiths  
have the space to preserve the knowledge of "non-believers."

### 10. Multiple Paths: Greek Civilization "Returns Home"  
Greek knowledge did not suddenly "revive" in Europe one day;  
it underwent a long and winding journey of civilization transfer.

Three key paths:  

1. **The Fourth Crusade (1204)**  
   The Crusaders did not head to Muslim regions,  
   but instead looted Constantinople,  
   bringing back numerous Greek manuscripts to Western Europe.  

2. **The Arab-Latin Translation Movement in the Iberian Peninsula**  
   European scholars actively traveled to Muslim-controlled areas to study,  
   re-accessing classical works like those of Aristotle and Euclid  
   through Arabic translations.  

3. **The Westward Migration of Scholars After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453**  
   Byzantine scholars fled to Italy with Greek originals,  
   directly contributing to the early humanistic and academic revival of the Renaissance.  

In this process of returning,  
the transmission sequence of Greek civilization is clearly visible:  

**Greek → Arabic → Latin → Europe**

This was not a revival of antiquity,  
but a cross-civilization, cross-language, cross-religion return of knowledge.

### 11. Decisive Rebuttal to the "Western Pseudo-History Theory"  
In recent years, a claim has gained popularity:  

"Ancient Greek civilization was fabricated after the Renaissance."

However, this claim is untenable both logically and evidentially:  

- Greek originals were preserved in Byzantium  
- Independently translated by the opposing civilization of the Arab world  
- Then re-translated from Arabic into Latin  

📌 This is cross-verification across multiple civilizations, languages, and religions.

If it were fabricated, one would have to assume:  

- Christian civilization  
- Islamic civilization  
- Byzantine civilization  

collaborated to forge history for hundreds of years despite long-standing hostility—  
which is historically impossible.

### 12. Religious Reformation: Rationality Finally Becomes Legitimate  
Even when knowledge returned to Europe,  
it was initially not "safe."

It was not until the 16th-century Reformation  
that Europe's intellectual environment fundamentally changed.

With Martin Luther's Reformation:  

- The Pope's absolute authority was weakened  
- Personal reading and interpretation were recognized  
- Academia gradually broke free from direct theological censorshipAncient Greek rationality finally ceased to be a "dangerous pagan heritage" and once again became a knowledge system that was allowed, studied, and developed.

13. How Greek Civilization Ignited the Renaissance (15th-17th Century)

When this knowledge re-entered Europe, it directly stimulated the birth of a generation of geniuses.

Da Vinci: Anatomy, Proportion, Perspective

Galileo: Describing nature with mathematics, directly inheriting the spirit of ancient Greek science

📌 They did not appear out of thin air, but rather stood again on the shoulders of ancient Greece.

Conclusion Civilization does not disappear out of thin air, nor is it born out of thin air. The knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome:

Was not fabricated

Nor did it naturally perish

It was merely:

Language fracture

System collapse

Religious monopoly

Political isolation

When conditions are restored, rationality naturally returns.

History is not a matter of emotion, but a matter of evidence.
