In the early days of human civilization, religion was like a chaotic **"startup competition."**

Initially, our ancestors, out of fear,  
called thunder "father"  
and rain "mother,"  
thus creating the primitive worship of **"animism."**

Later—  
The ancient Egyptians deified their pets (jackals, cats),  
while the ancient Greeks raised a group of "superpowered giant babies" on Mount Olympus.  
Zeus and his family,  
instead of handling serious matters,  
spent their days busy with infidelity and infighting.

But eventually, a more efficient and monopolistic business model emerged:  
Monotheism, a highly self-consistent logic—  
There is only one "Big Boss" in the sky,  
and only one "CEO" needed on earth.

The founder of this monopoly business?  
None other than—Abraham (also known as Ibrahim).

### I. Family Feuds: An Ethical Drama That Changed Geopolitics  

All major events that changed the world  
may have initially stemmed from one simple issue—  
the legitimate wife couldn't have children.  

Abraham was a successful entrepreneur,  
but he had a personal problem:  
His wife Sarah was infertile.  

So—  
He had a son, Ishmael, with his maidservant Hagar.  
Later, Sarah miraculously conceived and gave birth to a second son, Isaac.  

To avoid inheritance disputes,  
Hagar and her son were exiled to the desert.  

This "legitimate vs. illegitimate" conflict  
became the most expensive family split in human history:  

- Isaac (legitimate second son)  
  → Became the ancestor of the Jewish people  
  → His descendants included Moses and Jesus  

- Ishmael (illegitimate first son)  
  → Became the ancestor of the Arab people  
  → His descendants included the Prophet Muhammad  

A fascinating scientific coincidence:  
Modern genetics (Y-chromosome haplogroups)  
astonishingly confirms this legend—  

Jews predominantly carry J2,  
Arabs predominantly carry J1.  
These two genetic groups indeed share the same "father" from 4,000 years ago.  

So, the current Middle Eastern conflicts are essentially two brothers fighting over their ancestral home.

### II. Product Iterations: The "Rebranding History" from 1.0 to 3.0  

Although the family split,  
the foundational "code" of the three brothers remains the same.  

The evolution of these three major religions is essentially  
the continuous upgrade of the same software.  

- **Judaism | Foundation Version 1.0**  
  The core is the "Old Testament,"  
  a VIP invitation-only product.  
  Jews consider themselves God's "exclusive beta testers"—  
  proud, exclusive, and rarely accepting new users.  

- **Christianity | Global Expansion Version 2.0**  
  Then came Jesus.  
  As "God's spokesperson,"  
  he transformed the product from "Jews-only"  
  to "universal access."  

  ⚠️ Key point:  
  Jesus himself never wrote a single word.  
  What we see in the "New Testament"  
  are memoirs written by his followers decades later.  

  This means:  
  Christianity, from its inception, has been a history of interpretation.  

- **Islam | Final Patch Version 3.0**  
  Muhammad believed:  
  The first two versions had been "ruined by the product managers."  
  So, he directly launched the final revised version—the "Quran."  

  A large-scale "localization" effort:  
  - Abraham → Ibrahim  
  - Jesus → Isa  
  - Mary → Maryam  

  The logic is simple:  
  "My elder brothers misinterpreted the scriptures, so I’m here to set the record straight."

### III. The Art of Interpretation: How Did Polygamy "Disappear"?  

If the script is similar,  
why do their ways of life differ so drastically?  

The answer lies in one sentence:  
The text is static; interpretation is dynamic.  

Take "polygamy" as an example.  
Many people think it’s a "benefit" of a particular religion,  
but its origin lies in Judaism.  

In "Exodus 21:10,"  
God even thoughtfully provided a "concubine guide":  
"If he takes another wife, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing, and marital rights."  

King Solomon had 700 wives,  
and God didn’t expel him.  

So why do Christians practice monogamy today?  

- **Christianity's "Survival Instinct"**  
  To spread their faith in the monogamous Roman Empire,  
  they forcibly changed the rules through interpretation.  

- **Judaism's "Going with the Flow"**  
  It wasn’t until around 1000 AD  
  that polygamy was officially abolished.  

The scriptures didn’t change;  
the "CEO" violated the ancient contract to adapt to the market.

### IV. A Historical Role Reversal: Who Is the True Fundamentalist?  

Today's social media narrative is:  
- West = Open  
- Middle East = Conservative  

But 1,000 years ago,  
the roles were reversed.  

- **Veiled Christian Women**  
  "1 Corinthians 11:6" is very clear:  
  "If a woman does not cover her head, she should cut off her hair."  

  In medieval Europe—  
  Women going out uncovered = impure.  
  Christianity was closed-minded and ignorant,  
  busy burning scientists at the stake.  

- **The "Silicon Valley" Baghdad**  
  Meanwhile, the Muslim world was a beacon of civilization:  
  Translating Greek philosophy,  
  Inventing algebra,  
  Extremely tolerant of other religions—  
  As long as you paid a small tax (protection fee),  
  everyone was treated as brothers.  

In short:  
Back then, London was like today’s Afghanistan,  
while Baghdad was like today’s New York.

### V. Martin Luther: The "Decentralization Revolution" in Religion  

In the 16th century,  
Christianity’s shift toward secularism  
was driven by a true commercial revolution.  

At the time, the Pope was:  
The world’s largest middleman.  
To get to heaven, you had to buy indulgences.  

Martin Luther couldn’t stand it:  
"Every believer is a priest."  
He directly cut out the middleman.  

It was equivalent to—  
Eliminating the monopoly of physical stores,  
allowing users to connect directly to the server (God).  

This decisive move had immediate effects:  
- Thought became free.  
- The Pope was no longer the highest authority.  
- Science, rationality, and the Industrial Revolution began to take root.

### VI. Conclusion: Texts Are Remnants; Interpretation Is the Soul  

Today, the proportion of Protestants in developed countries continues to decline.  
Churches have become backdrops for weddings and social events.  

It’s not that the scriptures have lost their power,  
but rather—  
interpretation has fulfilled its mission of secularization.  

Looking back at 4,000 years of family feuds, you’ll realize:  

- No religion is inherently extreme.  
- No doctrine is inherently modern.  

All conflicts are essentially a war over—  
the power of interpretation.  

Whoever can "mod" the text to keep up with the times  
gets a ticket to modern civilization.  
Whoever clings to the remnants of the past  
turns themselves into a painful statue.  

History is never a cycle;  
it’s an endless war over interpretation.
