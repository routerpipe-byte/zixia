In the early days of human civilization, religion was like a chaotic **"startup competition."**

At first, our ancestors, out of fear, 

called the thunder "dad," 

called the rain "mom," 

and created the primitive worship of "everything has a spirit."

Later—

The ancient Egyptians deified pets (jackals, cats), 

while the ancient Greeks raised a group of "super-powered infants" on Mount Olympus.

Zeus and his family,

aside from their serious business, 

were busy with affairs and conflicts every day.

But eventually, a more efficient and monopolistic business model emerged:

Monotheism, with its extremely coherent logic—

There is only one "Big Boss" in heaven, 

and only one "CEO" is needed on earth.

And the founder of this monopolistic business is—

Abraham (also known as Ibrahim).

1. Family Feuds: An Ethical Drama that Changed Geopolitics

All major events that changed the world 

may have initially been caused by—

the main wife being unable to bear children. Abraham was a successful entrepreneur, 

but he had a difficult secret:

His primary wife, Sarah, was barren.

So—

He had a firstborn son with his maid, Hagar: Ishmael.

Later, the primary wife miraculously became pregnant and gave birth to a second son: Isaac.

To avoid a family inheritance dispute, 

Hagar and her son were exiled to the desert.

This "legitimate vs. illegitimate" struggle 

became the most expensive family division in human history:

Isaac (the legitimate second son)

→ became the ancestor of the Jews

→ and incidentally gave rise to Moses and Jesus in later generations.

Ishmael (the illegitimate firstborn)

→ became the ancestor of the Arabs

→ and from his descendants emerged the prophet Muhammad.

The miraculous coincidence of science:

Modern genetics (Y chromosome haplogroups) 

astonishingly confirms this legend—

Jews primarily belong to J2 

and Arabs primarily belong to J1.

These two genetic groups indeed had the same "dad" 4,000 years ago.

It turns out that the current conflicts in the Middle East are essentially just two brothers fighting over inheritance rights.

2. Product Iteration: The "Shell History" from 1.0 to 3.0

Although they separated, 

the underlying code of the three brothers is actually the same.

The evolution of these three major religions is essentially 

the continuous upgrading of the same software.

Judaism | Foundation Version 1.0

The core is the "Old Testament"

A VIP invitation-only product

Jews consider themselves "exclusive beta testers" of God.

Proud and exclusive, they basically do not accept new users.

Christianity | Overseas Promotion Version 2.0

Jesus appeared.

As the "spokesperson for God," 

he transformed the product from "exclusive to Jews" 

to "universal for all."

⚠️ Here comes the key point:

Jesus himself never wrote a single word. What we see in the "New Testament" 

is a "memoir" written by his followers decades later.

This means:

From its inception, Christianity has been a history of interpretation.

Islam | Ultimate Patch Version 3.0

Muhammad believed:

The first two versions were ruined by the "product managers." So he directly launched the final revised version— the "Quran."

A large-scale "localization" scene:

Abraham → Ibrahim

Jesus → Isa

Mary → Maryam

The logic is simple:

The older brothers misread the scriptures, so I come to clarify the original text.

3. The Art of Interpretation: How Did Polygamy "Disappear"?

Since the scripts are similar, 

why do everyone's ways of life differ so greatly?

The answer is just one sentence:

Words are dead, but the right to interpret is alive.

Taking "polygamy" as an example.

Many people think this is a "benefit" of a certain religion, 

but its ancestor is Judaism.

In Exodus 21:10, 

God even thoughtfully formulated a "concubine guide":

"If he takes another wife, her food, clothing, and marital rights must not be diminished." King Solomon had 700 wives, 

and God did not expel him.

So why do Christians practice monogamy now?

Christianity's "survival instinct"

To preach in the monogamous Roman Empire, 

they forcibly changed the rules using the right to interpret.

Judaism's "following the trend"

did not officially abolish polygamy until around 1000 AD.

The scriptures remained unchanged, but the CEO adapted the interpretation of a contract from thousands of years ago to fit the market.

4. The Historical Turning Point: Who Is the True Fundamentalist?

Today's social media narrative is:

The West = open, the Middle East = conservative, but 1,000 years ago, 

this was a large-scale reversal scene.

The masked Christians wrote clearly in 1 Corinthians 11:6:

"If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off." In medieval Europe— 

women going out without proper head coverings = unclean.

Christianity was closed and ignorant, 

busy burning scientists.

Meanwhile, the Muslim world was a beacon of civilization:

Translating Greek philosophy, 

inventing algebra, 

and being extremely tolerant of pagans.

As long as they paid a little tax (protection fee), 

everyone was good brothers.

In summary:

London back then was like Afghanistan now, and Baghdad back then was like New York now.

5. Martin Luther: The "Decentralization Revolution" in Religion

In the 16th century, 

Christianity was able to reverse its path towards secularism 

because of a true commercial revolution.

At that time, the Pope was:

The world's largest middleman.

To get to heaven, one had to buy indulgences.

Martin Luther could not stand it:

"Every believer is a priest." He directly decentralized.

This is equivalent to—

Canceling the monopoly of physical stores, 

allowing users to connect directly to the server (God).

With this cut, the effect was immediate:

Thought began to be free, 

the Pope was no longer the highest authority, 

and the scientific, rational, and industrial revolutions began to take root.

6. Conclusion: Words Are Remains, Interpretation Is the Soul

Today, the proportion of Protestants in developed countries continues to decline, 

and churches have become backdrops for weddings and social events.

It is not that the scriptures have become ineffective, 

but rather—

the right to interpret has completed its mission of secularization.

Looking back at the 4,000 years of family feuds, you will find:

No religion is inherently extreme, 

nor is any doctrine inherently modern.

All the games are essentially a—

war over the right to interpret.

Whoever can "magically modify" the text to follow the times can obtain the ticket to modern civilization; whoever clings to the remains will turn themselves into a painful statue.

History is never a cycle, 

but an infinite war over the right to interpret.
