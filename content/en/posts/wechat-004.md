In human history, there are certain questions that have been repeatedly asked for thousands of years.

What is time?

Does life have meaning?

Is death something to be feared?

Do humans truly have free will?

Where do good and evil ultimately come from?

These questions have long been categorized under "philosophy" or "metaphysics," wrapped in layers of mythology, religion, metaphor, and intense emotion.

But today, with the development of physics, neuroscience, and information theory, we have the possibility for the first time—

To answer these questions anew using science and reason, without relying on faith or appealing to emotion.

Before we begin, it's necessary to establish a consensus:

What is a "scientific answer"?

1. The Boundaries of Science: A Reaffirmation of Definitions The "science" here is not a collection of conclusions, nor a value stance, but a set of continuously operating cognitive methods.

It must at least meet the following conditions:

Observability: The subject of discussion must leave observable traces in the physical world, not purely imagined.

Inductiveness: Laws come from the accumulation of facts, not a priori assumptions.

Verifiability: Conclusions must be able to withstand experimental or real-world testing, not just be logically coherent.

Repeatability: Laws should not depend on the identity of the observer (such as "enlightened ones" or "geniuses") and should yield the same results under the same conditions.

Based on this method, we attempt to provide contemporary rational answers to the following ancient questions.

2. What is time? Traditional intuition:

Time is a uniformly flowing, absolute river shared by everyone.

Scientific answer:

Time does not exist as an independent entity but is a geometric property of spacetime.

In Einstein's general relativity, there is no absolute time, nor absolute space.

We exist in a unified four-dimensional spacetime structure.

The speed of light c is not an ordinary constant of speed but a fundamental scale used to unify the measurement of space and time in the spacetime structure.

In the "block universe" model, time does not exist in a "flowing" manner,

but is presented as a dimension within the spacetime structure, just like space itself.

The reason humans perceive the passage of time is not because time itself is special,

but because our biological structure limits us to move unidirectionally in the time dimension.

The so-called "now" is not a special moment in the universe but a perspective effect brought about by our perception mechanism.

3. What is the meaning of life? Common answers:

Happiness, success, legacy, or some emotional "sense of mission."

Rational answer:

Meaning is not emotional comfort but a goal function at the level of civilization.

Apart from individual experience, the existence logic of humans as a complex system can be summarized as:

Delaying entropy increase locally and continuously understanding, compressing, and modeling the laws of the universe. This is not motivational speaking but a fact of civilizational evolution:

Discovering natural laws and establishing physical models;

Transforming the universe's information structure into forms understandable and inheritable by humans;

Individuals may perish, but the cognitive structures built by civilization can continue to persist at the information level.

4. How to face death? Intuitive reaction:

Fear, avoidance, or hope for some form of immortality.

Rational answer:

Death is a certainty with a probability of 100%.

From a biological perspective, death is part of the evolutionary mechanism, providing necessary space for gene renewal and system reorganization.

For a certain event, fear can neither change its probability of occurrence nor produce any positive benefit.

Since death treats all beings equally, it loses its threat to the individual.

Calmly accepting the inevitable is the optimal strategy for a rational system facing natural laws.

5. Where does consciousness come from? Does free will exist? Scientific perspective:

Consciousness is an emergent phenomenon in complex systems.

The human brain consists of tens of billions of neurons, interconnected through electrical and chemical signals.

This structure is highly similar to modern artificial intelligence models at the logical level:

Hardware layer: Neurons and synaptic weights;

Training process: Experience, learning, and sensory input;

Emergent result: When the system's complexity exceeds a critical point, intelligence and consciousness emerge.

Consciousness is not some supernatural entity but a natural product of self-organizing systems at high complexity.

As for free will, it may not mean "transcending physical causality,"

but more likely arises from the incomputability and unpredictability of complex systems.

This macro uncertainty due to complexity is perceived at the subjective experience level as "free choice."

6. If there is no absolute time, is there still causality? Scientific answer:

Yes. But causality is not equal to "sequence," but to structural constraints.

In modern physical and logical frameworks, causality should be understood as:

The reachability of state transitions under given spacetime and information structures.

Causality is not about who "pushes" whom;

Causality is the structure itself limiting possibilities—

Some states are allowed, while others are structurally impossible.

Even from a perspective that does not rely on linear time,

the structure still strictly dictates the evolutionary logic of the world.

Causality is not an accessory to time but a constraint of the structure itself.

7. Does choice truly exist? Scientific answer:

The answer depends on the dimension of observation you are in.

In a high-dimensional structure:

All possible paths exist simultaneously as a whole geometric structure, and there is no "choice."

In a low-dimensional projection:

The observer can only see a slice of the high-dimensional structure, making "choice" real and unavoidable.

This is similar to the projection of a three-dimensional object onto a plane:

The shadow is not false but an inevitable manifestation of high-dimensional reality in the low-dimensional world.

Therefore:

Choice is a geometric position in the high-dimensional perspective and a real decision in the low-dimensional world.

8. What is morality? Where do good and evil come from? Traditional understanding:

Good and evil come from divine commands, innate conscience, or some value system beyond nature.

Rational answer:

Good and evil are not moral judgments of the universe but natural results of structural stability.

The universe does not "judge" behavior itself, but different structures have varying abilities to persist.

From the perspective of information theory and complex systems, the universe tends to preserve those:

Structures that can be modeled;

Structures that can be predicted and explained;

Complex structures that can remain stable amidst disturbances and continue to evolve.

When this structural preference is projected onto the human societal level, it forms what we call "morality."

Behaviors conducive to the long-term stability, cooperation, and continuation of complex systems are called "good";

Behaviors that disrupt system stability and reduce overall complexity are called "evil."

Good and evil are not labels bestowed by the universe,

but experiential inductions made by humans over long-term evolution about which behaviors help systems sustainably exist.

From this perspective:

Morality is not an emotional declaration;

Not a supernatural command;

But an evolved structural constraint.

It serves not individual emotions but the sustainability of complex systems themselves.

9. Conclusion: When reason intervenes, problems automatically "invalidate" When we attempt to re-examine these ancient questions with science, an intriguing phenomenon occurs:

Some questions are solved;

Some questions are redefined;

And some questions automatically become invalid.

Time no longer needs mythology,

Meaning no longer relies on emotion,

Good and evil no longer appeal to the transcendental,

Death no longer incites fear.

This does not mean the world has become indifferent,

But that we are finally beginning to understand it with structure, laws, and verifiable language.

When attention shifts from "seeking meaning" to "understanding structure,"

From "moral declarations" to "system stability,"

The world instead becomes unprecedentedly clear, transparent, and calm.

When problems become invalid, perhaps it is precisely where understanding truly begins.
